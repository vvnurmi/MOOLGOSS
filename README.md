MOOLGOSS
===

A multiplayer game of space exploration and conquest.

For now, MOOLGOSS is at an early brainstorming and technology test phase.
In the future the game may even get a proper name.

Setting Up the Development Environment
---
1. Install Visual Studio 2012 Express for Desktop (or newer).
2. Clone both the Git and boar repositories.
    - The boar working folder has to be called *Gamedata* and it has to reside next to your Git working folder.
    - Get boar from <https://code.google.com/p/boar/>
    - The boar repo contains art assets and is currently private. For access, contact someone who's working on the project.
3. Enable NuGet Package Restore for the solution.
    - This happens by right-clicking on the solution in Solution Explorer and choosing *Enable NuGet Package Restore*.
4. Compile and run the *Client* project.
    - The test server may not be online at all times. If it's not, the client may not work at all.
