thrift-0.9.0.exe comes from the Thrift 0.9.0 Nuget package.

thrift.exe is downloaded from the attachment of Apache Thrift issue
THRIFT-1223 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-1223) and then
packed to save some space. It generates AS3 code that is compatible with the
patched AS3 Thrift library that supports sockets. Also the patched libarary is
available in the attachments of that same Apache Thrift issue. The patched
generator is probably based on some Apache Thrift version prior to 0.9.0.
